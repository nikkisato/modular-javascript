# Challenge

## [Week 5]: Create a new project with 2 js files and 1 html file.

- Make sure you add both js files to the html file - <script src=â€¦
- Create a function in each js file.
- But - the function in the second js file needs information from the function in the first js file - how can this be done
- Can you invoke the function from the second file in the first file?
- Bonus: there are several ways to do this - see how many you can implement, and think about the drawbacks of some ways
